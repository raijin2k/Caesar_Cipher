# Caesar_Cipher

The Caesar cipher uses keys, which encrypt the message differently depending on which key is used. The keys for the Caesar cipher are the integers from 0 to 25. Even if a cryptanalyst knows the Caesar cipher was used, that alone doesnâ€™t give them enough information to break the cipher. They must also know the key.
